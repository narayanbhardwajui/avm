              <p>This report form is designed to report an appraisal of the cooperative interest (the cooperative shares
                or other evidence of an ownership interest in the cooperative corporation and the accompanying occupancy
                rights) in a cooperative project or the cooperative interest in a planned unit development (PUD) based
                on an interior and exterior inspection of the subject property. This form is not designed to report an
                appraisal of a manufactured home or a unit in a condominium project.</p>
              <div class="mb-5 border-bottom mt-5">
                <h3>Modifications, Additions, or Deletions</h3>
                <p>This appraisal report is subject to the scope of work, intended use, intended user, definition of
                  market value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications contained in the
                  report form. Modifications, additions, or deletions to the intended use, intended user, definition of
                  market value, or assumptions and limiting conditions are not permitted. The appraiser may expand the
                  scope of work to include any additional research or analysis necessary based on the complexity of this
                  appraisal assignment. Modifications or deletions to the certifications are also not permitted.
                  However,
                  additional certifications that do not constitute material alterations to this appraisal report, such
                  as
                  those required by law or those related to the appraiser’s continuing education or membership in an
                  appraisal organization are permitted.</p>

                <h3>Scope of Work</h3>
                <p>The scope of work for this appraisal is defined by the complexity of this appraisal assignment and
                  the
                  reporting requirements of this appraisal report form, including the following definition of market
                  value, statement of assumptions and limiting conditions, and certifications. The appraiser must, at a
                  minimum: (1) perform a complete visual inspection of the interior and exterior areas of the subject
                  unit, (2) inspect and analyze the cooperative project, (3) inspect the neighborhood, (4) inspect each
                  of
                  the comparable sales from at least the street, (5) research, verify, and analyze data from reliable
                  public and/or private sources, and (6) report his or her analysis, opinions, and conclusions in this
                  appraisal report.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="mb-5 border-bottom mt-5">
                <h3>New Projects</h3>
                <p>For units in new (or recently converted) cooperative projects, the appraiser must compare the subject
                  property to other properties in its general market area as well as to properties within the subject
                  project. This comparison should help demonstrate market acceptance of new developments and the
                  properties within them. Generally, the appraiser should select one comparable sale from the subject
                  project, one comparable sale from outside the subject project, and one other comparable sale, which
                  can
                  be from inside or outside of the subject project, that the appraiser considers to be a good indicator
                  of
                  value for the subject property. In selecting the comparables, the appraiser should keep in mind that
                  re-sales from within the subject project are preferable to sales from outside the project as long as
                  the
                  developer or builder of the subject property is not involved in the transactions.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="mb-5 border-bottom mt-5">
                <h3>Established Projects</h3>
                <p>For units in established cooperative projects (those that have resale activity), the appraiser should
                  use comparable sales from within the subject project if there are any available. Resale activity from
                  within the subject project should be the best indicator of value for properties in that project. If
                  the
                  appraiser uses sales of comparable properties that are located outside of the subject neighborhood, he
                  or she must include an explanation with the analysis.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="mb-5 border-bottom mt-5">
                <h3>Required Exhibits</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>A street map that shows the location of the subject property and of all comparables that the
                    appraiser used;</li>
                  <li>A sketch of the subject unit that must indicate interior perimeter unit dimensions rather than
                    exterior building dimensions. Generally, the appraiser must also include calculations to show how he
                    or she arrived at the estimate for gross living area; however, for a unit in a cooperative project,
                    the appraiser may rely on the dimensions and estimate for gross living area that are shown on the
                    plat. In such cases, the appraiser does not need to provide a sketch of the unit as long as he or
                    she
                    includes a copy of the plat with the appraisal report. A floor plan sketch that indicates the
                    dimensions is required instead of the exterior building or unit sketch if the floor plan is atypical
                    or functionally obsolete, thus limiting the market appeal for the property in comparison to
                    competitive properties in the neighborhood;</li>
                  <li>Clear, descriptive photographs (either in black and white or color) that show the front, back, and
                    a
                    street scene of the subject property, and that are appropriately identified. (Photographs must be
                    originals that are produced either by photography or electronic imaging.);</li>
                  <li>Clear, descriptive photographs (either in black and white or color) that show the front of each
                    comparable sale and that are appropriately identified. (We do not require photographs of comparable
                    rentals and listings.) Generally, photographs should be originals that are produced by photography
                    or
                    electronic imaging; however, copies of photographs from a multiple listing service or from the
                    appraiser’s files are acceptable if they are clear and descriptive;</li>
                  <li>Any other data–as an attachment or addendum to the appraisal report form–that are necessary to
                    provide an adequately supported opinion of market value.</li>

                software</li>
              <li>We do not utilize conversion software. We deliver the entire appraisal with all the information in the
                style and format submitted by the appraiser.</li>
              <li>We do not broadcast assignments to the first taker. Instead we take the time to make sure the right
                appraiser for the job gets each order</li>
            </ul>
